WindNLP is a machine learning project designed to analyze and predict high wind conditions using an XLNet-based model. While XLNet is traditionally used in natural language processing, this project leverages its capabilities to process sequential data for weather forecasting, specifically focusing on wind speed and gust prediction in Banyuwangi.

Key Features:
- Data Cleaning and Preprocessing: Comprehensive preprocessing steps to handle missing values and ensure data quality for accurate predictions.
- Sequence Analysis with XLNet: Utilizes XLNet's transformer architecture to capture temporal dependencies in wind data, allowing for precise modeling of wind conditions.
- Performance Metrics: Evaluation of model performance with metrics like Mean Absolute Error, Precision, Recall, and F1 Score.
- Application in Meteorology: By adapting NLP techniques to meteorological data, this project showcases innovative methods to enhance weather prediction.
